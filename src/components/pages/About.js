            <p className='card-text'>
                Being a mechanical engineer for about a decade I realized most of my enjoyment came from working with software.
                From programming automated machinery to managing complex parametric databases, my passion for computation continued to grow.
                During the pandemic I had time to rethink my trajectory and soon realized it was time for me to pursue my true interest of computers, how they worked, and how to write code.
                Taking the Full-Stack Web Development course at UT Austin has truly ignited a passion and curiosity for the art of coding.
                I look forward to turning this passion into a profession.
